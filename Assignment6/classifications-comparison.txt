Comparing the 3 feature spaces, perceptual features performed best in classifying music and speech as shown in the table below. It has the highest TP rate of 96.1% and lowest FP rate of 3.9%.

Possible reason for its best performance is MFCC uses mel-frequency that approximates the human auditory system's response to sounds of different frequencies. Using MFCC can distinguish the 2 classes better as it uses non linearly spaced frequency bands just like human hearing system.

Except for the lazy.LWL algorithm on time-domain feature space, which performed as good as LMT on MFCC, all other algorithms performed worse than LMT on MFCC.
